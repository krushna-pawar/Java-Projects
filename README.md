# Java-Projects
This repository contains **all my Java programs**, from the very first "Hello World" type to more advanced logic-based applications.  
It's a personal learning log as I grow from basics to expert-level Java development.

## 📂 Projects Included

## FirstJavaProgram
> My first ever Java code — understanding structure, `main()` method, and console output.

## SumOfTwoNumbers
> A simple program using `BigInteger` to add two large numbers, demonstrating input handling and basic arithmetic.

## AutomaticTypePromotionInExpressions
> Demonstrates type promotion of byte to int in arithmetic expressions.
Multiplication of bytes is auto-promoted before evaluation.

## TypeCasting
> Performs typecasting in a mixed expression with byte, char, int, float, and double.
Demonstrates Java's automatic type promotion and mixed-type evaluation.

## TempConversionCToF
> Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the standard formula.
Takes user input and prints the converted result.

## WhichIsTheBiggerNumber
> Compares two numbers entered by the user.
Prints the bigger number using simple conditional checks.

## EvenOrOdd
> Checks if a large integer is even or odd using the % operator.
Uses long type to support very large number input safely.

## EMICalculator
> Calculates monthly EMI based on loan amount, annual interest rate, and tenure.
Uses the standard EMI formula with compound interest applied monthly.
