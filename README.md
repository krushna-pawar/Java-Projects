# Java-Projects
This repository contains **all my Java programs**, from the very first "Hello World" type to more advanced logic-based applications.  
It's a personal learning log as I grow from basics to expert-level Java development.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

## FirstJavaProgram
> My first ever Java code â€” understanding structure, `main()` method, and console output.

## SumOfTwoNumbers
> A simple program using `BigInteger` to add two large numbers, demonstrating input handling and basic arithmetic.

## AutomaticTypePromotionInExpressions
> Demonstrates type promotion of byte to int in arithmetic expressions.
Multiplication of bytes is auto-promoted before evaluation.

## TypeCasting
> Performs typecasting in a mixed expression with byte, char, int, float, and double.
Demonstrates Java's automatic type promotion and mixed-type evaluation.

## TempConversionCToF
> Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the standard formula.
Takes user input and prints the converted result.

## WhichIsTheBiggerNumber
> Compares two numbers entered by the user.
Prints the bigger number using simple conditional checks.

## EvenOrOdd
> Checks if a large integer is even or odd using the % operator.
Uses long type to support very large number input safely.

## EMICalculator
> Calculates monthly EMI based on loan amount, annual interest rate, and tenure.
Uses the standard EMI formula with compound interest applied monthly.

## IsItCapital
> Type a letter, and this program tells you if itâ€™s uppercase or lowercase. Simple.

## FibonacciSeriesCalculator
> Calculates the Fibonacci number at the position you enter. Uses a loop to get the result.

## CountingOccurrences
> Enter a number, and it counts how many times each digit (0â€“9) appears. Basic and useful.

## ReverseNumbers
> Takes a number and prints its reverse. Simple digit manipulation with a loop.

## BasicCalc
> A basic calculator that keeps running until you exit with 'x'. Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (with zero check), and modulo.
